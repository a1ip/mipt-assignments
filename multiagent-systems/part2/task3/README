What evidence is provided that the traits are useful - that they adequately represent the mechanisms that seem important for the system and problem being modeled?

"Recent research has indicated that changes in migration phenology of beluga whales in the Arctic are triggered by changes in the thermal structure of the marine environment in their summering area"

Was any effort made to try alternative traits, or to show that the selected traits work better than a null model?

No.

What evidence is provided that the traits are useful - that they adequately represent the mechanisms that seem important for the system and problem being modeled?

POM.

Was any effort made to try alternative traits, or to show that the selected traits work better than a null model?

"Four alternative foraging theories were contrasted by how well they caused the model to reproduce the nine characteristic patterns. Four of these patterns were clearly reproduced with the "null" theory that birds select habitat randomly.
